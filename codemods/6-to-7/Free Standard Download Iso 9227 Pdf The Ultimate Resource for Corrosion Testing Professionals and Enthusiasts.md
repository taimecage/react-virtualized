# How to Download ISO 9227:2022 for Free
 
ISO 9227:2022 is an international standard that specifies the apparatus, the reagents and the procedure to be used in conducting the neutral salt spray (NSS), acetic acid salt spray (AASS) and copper-accelerated acetic acid salt spray (CASS) tests for assessment of the corrosion resistance of metallic materials, with or without permanent or temporary corrosion protection[^1^].
 
These tests are useful for detecting discontinuities, such as pores and other defects, in certain metallic, organic, anodic oxide and conversion coatings. They are also suitable for checking that the quality of a metallic material, with or without corrosion protection, is maintained[^1^].

ISO 9227:2022 is the latest edition of this standard, which has been revised from ISO 9227:2017[^1^]. The main changes are as follows[^3^]:
 
- the introduction of a new test solution for NSS test;
- the introduction of a new test solution for AASS test;
- the introduction of a new test solution for CASS test;
- the introduction of a new method for evaluating the corrosivity of the test cabinet environment;
- the introduction of a new method for determining the pH value of the collected spray;
- the introduction of a new method for determining the chloride content of the collected spray;
- the introduction of a new method for determining the copper content of the collected spray;
- the introduction of a new method for determining the acetic acid content of the collected spray;
- the introduction of a new method for determining the conductivity of the collected spray;
- the introduction of a new method for determining the density of the test solutions;
- the introduction of a new method for determining the refractive index of the test solutions;
- the revision of some requirements for the apparatus and its calibration;
- the revision of some requirements for the preparation and maintenance of the test solutions;
- the revision of some requirements for the exposure conditions and duration;
- the revision of some requirements for the evaluation of test specimens.
