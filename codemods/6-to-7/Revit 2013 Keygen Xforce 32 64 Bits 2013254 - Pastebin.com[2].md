Revit 2013 is not only a design software, but also a powerful tool for construction modeling. Construction modeling is the process of creating detailed and accurate models of building elements and systems that reflect how they will be built and installed on site. Construction modeling can help improve coordination, communication, and quality control among project stakeholders.
 
One of the features that supports construction modeling in Revit 2013 is the ability to create and modify parts. Parts are sub-elements of building components that can be divided, merged, excluded, or restored according to construction logic. For example, you can split a wall into parts based on layers, materials, or structural properties. You can then manipulate each part individually or combine them with other parts to form assemblies. You can also exclude parts from the model if they are not relevant for construction or restore them if needed.

Another feature that supports construction modeling in Revit 2013 is the ability to create and apply assemblies. Assemblies are collections of parts or components that are grouped together for fabrication, delivery, or installation purposes. For example, you can create an assembly of a curtain wall panel with its mullions, glazing, and hardware. You can then assign assembly codes, descriptions, and tags to identify and document the assembly. You can also create assembly views and sheets to show the assembly details and dimensions.
 
By using parts and assemblies in Revit 2013, you can create more realistic and accurate models of building elements and systems that reflect how they will be constructed on site. This can help you reduce errors, conflicts, and rework during the construction phase of your project.
